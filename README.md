# REVM Hardhat Examples

This repository contains a collection of basic examples demonstrating how to deploy and interact with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on Polkadot Hub using Hardhat and REVM (Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine). These examples showcase best practices for smart contract development in a modern Hardhat environment.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following example projects:

- [**erc20-hardhat**](./erc20-hardhat/) - implementation of an ERC-20 token contract using Hardhat


Each subfolder is a standalone Hardhat project with its own configuration, contracts, deployment scripts, and tests.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/polkadot-developers/revm-hardhat-examples.git
   cd revm-hardhat-examples
   ```

2. Navigate to any of the example directories
   ```bash
   cd erc20-hardhat
   ```

## Documentation

Each example folder contains its own README with specific instructions and explanations for that particular smart contract implementation.

For comprehensive guidance on deploying contracts to REVM using Hardhat, visit the [Hardhat Development Environment](https://docs.polkadot.com/smart-contracts/cookbook/smart-contracts/deploy-erc20/erc20-hardhat/) page in the official Polkadot documentation. This resource provides step-by-step instructions, configuration details, and best practices for smooth integration.
